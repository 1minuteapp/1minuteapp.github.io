<div><font size="4">Many of the tools and splash pages I have created using AI include <a href="https://leadsleap.com/?r=jimmyboyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LeadsLeap</a> PPC ads in the code. You get paid on these ads much like Google AdSense, but with some key differences. They aren't going to pay as much per click as the mighty Google. However,&nbsp; you are accepted WITHOUT having to apply and WITHOUT even having a website. You can freely put the ad code on any site that will accept the script. Github does display these ads. Here you go:</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div>
<script data-cfasync="false">ll_r="jimmyboyd";ll_bc="#ffffff";ll_hc="#e22121";ll_tc="#555a69";ll_cc="#8d9aa6";ll_dc="#8891a8";ll_w="";ll_nf="0";ll_nc="1";ll_nh="0";ll_nm="0";ll_np="1";ll_pa="0";ll_nt="0";ll_wt="1";ll_fw="1";ll_n="4";ll_cl="";ll_s="w";</script><script data-cfasync="false" src="https://w.leadsleap.com/js.js"></script>

<font size="4">Because these ads are used so much in my products, you should have the ad code from your own LeadsLeap account ready to go. Sign up for a free account first if you don't have one yet. They also provide free list building and ad tracking. So there are plenty of good reasons to have an account even if it is a free one.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">After you get an account, go to "Get PPC Widget Code" in the Earn menu. For a page like this, I choose 4 ads and "Responsive." You then just copy and paste the code where you need it. For example, I have splash page and PPC ad wizards linked to from the home page that will ask you to put in the code. So have it ready or at least know where to find it.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">In case you are wondering, I HAVE been paid by LeadsLeap. They pay and have been trustworthy.</font></div>
