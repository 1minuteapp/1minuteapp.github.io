I am experimenting with various splash page designs. Feel free to use anything
you find useful. These are splash pages, not sales letters. They are
designed to pique interest and entice visitors to click through to
the target sales page.

There may also be some preselling pages. These go farther than a splash page
and should ideally contain a bonus or special discount.

You can create splash pages using my AI-created Splash Page Wizard here:
