       <h2>This site is to experiment and provide examples of mostly AI-generated splash pages and related content pages and prewritten ad copy. However, I do
           write my own copy because AI makes a lot of factual errors and is better at listing features than using persuasive language. But AI is great at 
           making things look more polished.<p>You may copy anything you want. However, I make extensive use of bonuses in my
        ad copy. The bonuses will not necessarily be something that you know how to deliver to your own customers. If you want to know all of my tricks, get a lifetime upgrade in World Traffic Club or get Course Secrets or
        Expert Automation with the High Ticket Module. I will teach you everything so you can offer the same bonuses I do. Email me on the same day you purchase at teamcustomize.com@gmail.com to get my Stair Step Training, which is a step-by-step format.</h2></h2></p><br>

            Scaled Down Splash Page</a></font></div><div><font size="3">My experience is that putting the most important info above the fold tends to get attention 
                more than long-winded ad copy. This is a bare-bones splash page. It is designed to pique their attention fast, put them in the mood for more information, 
                and to click on the target link. This is not fancy, but that is kind of the point. We are trying to put people in a buying mood, not a mood to see 
                something fancy. There is also some LeadsLeap ad code. Just view the source of the page to get the HTML. You are welcome to use it.</font></div>
